Welcome! This RESTful WebService API requires a GlassFish application server to run correctly, likely due to the development environment used (IntelliJ).

To get started:

* Install the GlassFish application server.
* Deploy this WebService API to your GlassFish installation.
* You can manage your GlassFish server by navigating to localhost:4848 in your web browser.
